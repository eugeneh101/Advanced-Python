    "# Procedural Programming (Really Control Flow)\n",
    "#### Boring, Academic Definition (Nobody Cares Except Professors and Pedantic, Technical Interviewers...):\n",
    "Procedural Programming can be defined as a programming model (derived from structured programming), which focuses on calling procedures. __Procedures__, also known as routines, subroutines or __functions__, simply consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out.\n",
    "#### Reality:\n",
    "Simple, fairly boring code that just works well: tell the computer what to do step-by-step with control flow using conditions (`if/elif/else`), loops/iteration (`for/while/else`), \"jumping\" (`continue/break/return/pass`), and exception handling (`try/except/else/finally`). This notebook will focus on mastering __control flow__ inside and outside a function.  Don't be like Bruce Lee, be an Airbender: don't be like water, bend the (control) flow to your will.  "

    "#### Context for using `finally`: An Actual Use Case\n",
    "When would you use `finally`? `finally` is used when you want to clean up your environment/release resources: close files, close database connections, write final log messages, release locks, etc. For example, if you are connected to a SQL database but hit an exception during a query, you might have not released the database connection. A database has a limited number of connections it can handle at any one time. Hence, if Python does not release the connection to the database, nobody else can actually query the database. The `finally` block can be used to close a database connection, regardless of whether or not the SQL query completed successfully.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that sounds awfully like a context manager such as `with open(my_file) as f:` where the file will close itself (no matter what) when the body of the clause is finished executing. Your hunch is correct: `try/finally` can be used to create your own custom context managers.  \n",
