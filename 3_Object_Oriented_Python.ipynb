    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boring, Academic Definition (Nobody Cares Except Professors and Pedantic, Technical Interviewers...):\n",
    "There are 4 fundamental tenets of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "* `Encapsulation`: hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.\n",
    "* `Inheritance`: class hierarchies improve code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.\n",
    "* `Abstraction`: deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.\n",
    "* `Polymorphism`: same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical, Real-time Importance:\n",
    "We get an object that has functions (called methods) attached to them. You can store and change/manipulate data (called attributes) using methods. If you are fancy, you can build complex objects through inheritance and composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask why is C considered a produceral language if it has `array` (like a list of homogenous elements) and `struct` (like a list of different types) data types. Aren't they \"objects\"? Well, OOP gives you objects AND methods that are built into the definition of the class. C uses (separately defined) functions to modify their data structures.  \n",
    "To the other extreme, you have Java where you only get objects--there are no function calls. Even print is a method: `System.out.println()`  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Review: Practical OOP\n",
    "Everybody talks about Object Oriented Programming. Here's some actual useful functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lingo:\n",
    "* `class`: blueprints or definitions for creating an object. Another synonym for class is `type`.  \n",
    "* `object` (also called an instance): an actual, living, breathing creation of a `class`--the manifestation of building out what was in your blueprint. The process of creating an instance is called `instantiation`. A secondary definition is that everything (storable) in Python is an object. \n",
    "* `method`: a function you put inside a class.\n",
    "* `attribute`: a variable inside an instance (also called instance variable or instance member) or class (also called class variable or class member).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a Python object has 4 things: a type/class, data/attributes, methods, and a unique identity (which can be found by calling `id()`). At an even higher level, OOP's core principle is combining data and code together. The data has access to code that it can run on itself. Or you think of it inverted: the code has access to the data that is relevant to the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Types (What an OOP pun!) of Methods:\n",
    "* `instance method`: Most common (vast majority of time). Do something with the instance, ie update the instance's attributes or return something from that instance. Call from the instance.\n",
    "* `class method`: uncommon (maybe 10% of the time). Do something with the class, ie update the class's attributes or return something from that class. Call from the class or an instance.\n",
    "* `static method`: very uncommon (<5% of the time). Use no information about an instance or class, ie knows nothing about the instance or class. Just a regular function but you attached to a class (because it might be helpful). Call from the class or an instance."

When a DataFrames filters, does it could how know many rows it drops and update `.shape`? When a DataFrame adds more columns, does it update `.shape`? When a DataFrame performs groupby, does it update `.shape`? Nope--it's cheating!  \n",

    "1. A property doesn't know its value until it's called--that's how it's lazy. For things that are slow to extract (like accessing a row from a database), you don't want an instance to load up all its attributes. Hence, a property is a Just-In-Time calculation to prevent slow instantiation. Optionally, once the value is extracted, then it can be stored into a \"private\" attribute. Since there are no real private attributes in Python, \"private\" just means an attribute that a user isn't supposed to touch.   \n",

A `property` actually has 3 components: getter, setter, and deleter. If you don't implement the setter, then the property is read-only--as there is no way to set the value. Try to comment out the setter to see that attempting to assign a value to the property will raise an exception. The deleter doesn't have a cool name. It follows the same logic as the setter; without defining the deleter method, then the property cannot be deleted.   "

    "## Python's Data Model: (Magic) Methods All the Way Down\n",
    "Python's objects are really dictionaries. Even if `type(obj)` says `int` or `str`, the object is implemented with a dictionary, which holds all the methods, which are then accessed through magic methods, which are implemented by the Descriptor Protocol... Sorry, I lied to you: I'm not going to tell you about the Descriptor Protocol; it's just the low-level implementation detail that is not important to know. The more useful thing is to understand methods, attributes, `property`, and a few magic methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, everything is an object, all objects are really dictionaries underneath, and all useful things come from magic methods. So the next question naturally is what is a magic method?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods are also called dunder methods since dunder means double underscore. The most familiar magic method is `__init__`, but there are dozens of them. The reason for magic methods isn't because they are truly magic or special--they are just regular methods that Python object's already have implemented. For example, whenever you call `len(object)`, it is actually calling `object.__len__()`. When you implement your own magic methods inside the class, you are replacing their default behavior with your own; this is called <i>method overriding</i>. When you are doing anything substantive in Python, you are actually triggering a bunch of magic method calls.  "

That's why we method override `__init__()` in child classes, usually to set some instance attributes.  \n",

    "    * __MRO__: (Daisy, is it you? No, it's __M__ethod __R__esolution __O__rder): MRO determines which parent's method will be called when a child instance calls a method defined in both the parent classes. For example, if class `C` inherits from classes `A` and `B` and both `A` and `B` have a method called `who_is_my_parent()`, then MRO will determine if an instance of `C` will use the method defined in `A` (`A.who_is_my_parent()`) vs method defined in `B` (`B.who_is_my_parent()`).  The specific algorithm used to determine MRO is called __C3 linearization__, which also resolves something called the \"diamond problem.\" Due to the sophistication of multiple inheritance, some programmers recommend against using it.  \n",
    "* __mixin__: Something like a \"proto\" class in that mixins are regular classes that are not complete. You define a mixin class that has some functionality but is meant to be combined with other classes during multiple inheritance to make a final class you will actually want to use. An analogy is that you create a `Bun` mixin class and `Patty` mixin class--nobody would ever just eat an instance of only a bun or a patty. However, when you fuse them together through multiple inheritance, you can make a `Burger` class (`class Burger(Bun, Patty)`) that has aspects of both bun and patty. Instances of the `Burger` class will be very useful and very tasty!  \n",
    "* __abc/interface__: __A__bstract __B__ase __C__lass is where you define a fake class where the purpose is to figure out what the class will look like but not implement any of the methods. The abstract base class is like a template; you can define the method signatures but just put `pass` for the method body. Then, a real class inheritances from the abstract base class and overrides all the methods. For example, `sklearn` has the estimator interface, which tells you to implement the `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods. The difference between abc and interface is very small.  \n",
    "* __metaclass__: What is a class, a class of? To make an analogy, a class is to an object as a metaclass is to a class. A class's class is the metaclass--a metaclass can create classes. The default metaclass is `type`. Metaclasses are used to write frameworks when nothing else will do--very rare to use a metaclass, so a typical programmer will never have to use a metaclass. Don't worry about metaclasses. üòâ  \n",

    "* __name mangling__: applying double underscore `__` as a prefix in an class/instance attribute changes the attribute name such that child class will not accidentally overwrite the parent class's attribute.  \n",
    "* __alternative constructors__: have multiple ways to create instances of a class instead of solely `MyClass()`. For example, `datetime` instances can be created in multiple ways: `datetime(2013, 3, 16)`, `datetime.fromtimestamp(1363383616)`, `datetime.fromordinal(734000)`, `datetime.now()`. Alternative constructors are implemented by class methods in the class definition.  \n",
    "* __factory method__: Don't create the instances the normal way. Delegate it to a different class whose purpose is to figure which class is the suited for your needs and makes the instance of that class.   \n",
    "* other special magic methods: \n",
    "    * `__new__()` is the true constructor, not `__init__()`, which is the initializer. \n",
    "    * `__del__()` can be called during garbage collection but not guaranteed to be called. A context manager or making an explicit cleanup method (such as `release()`) might be better.  \n"
