    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boring, Academic Definition (Nobody Cares Except Professors and Pedantic, Technical Interviewers...):\n",
    "There are 4 fundamental tenets of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "* `Encapsulation`: hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.\n",
    "* `Inheritance`: class hierarchies improve code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.\n",
    "* `Abstraction`: deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.\n",
    "* `Polymorphism`: same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical, Real-time Importance:\n",
    "We have an object that has functions (called methods) attached to them. You can store and change/manipulate data (called attributes) using methods. If you are fancy, you can build complex objects through inheritance and composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask why is C considered a produceral language if it has `array` (like a list of homogenous elements) and `struct` (like a list of different types) data types. Aren't they \"objects\"? Well, OOP gives you objects AND methods that are built into the definition of the class. C uses (separately defined) functions to modify their data structures.  \n",
    "To the other extreme, you have Java where you *only* have objects--there are no function calls. Even print is a method: `System.out.println()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review: Practical OOP\n",
    "Everybody talks about Object Oriented Programming. Here's some actual useful functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lingo:\n",
    "* `class`: a blueprint or definition for creating an object. Another synonym for class is `type`.\n",
    "* `object` (also called an instance): an actual, living, breathing creation of a `class`--the manifestation of building out what was in your blueprint. The process of creating an instance is called `instantiation`. A secondary definition is that everything (storable) in Python is an object.\n",
    "* `method`: a function you put inside a class.\n",
    "* `attribute`: a variable inside an instance (also called instance variable or instance member) or class (also called class variable or class member).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a Python object has 3 main things: a type/class, data/attributes, methods. At an even higher level, OOP's core principle is combining data and code together. The data has access to code that it can run on itself. You can think of attributes as nouns and methods as verbs that act upon attributes. Or you can think of it in the inverse: the code has access to the data that is relevant to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Types (What an OOP pun!) of Methods:\n",
    "* `instance method`: Most common (vast majority of time). Do something with the instance, ie update the instance's attributes or return something from that instance. Call from the instance.\n",
    "* `class method`: uncommon (maybe 10% of the time). Do something with the class, ie update the class's attributes or return something from that class. Call from the class or an instance.\n",
    "* `static method`: very uncommon (<5% of the time). Use no information about an instance or class, ie knows nothing about the instance or class. Just a regular function but you attached to a class (because it might be helpful). Effectively guarantees that the class or instance is not mutated. Call from the class or an instance."

    "* Couldn't Python have just omitted `self` for the instance methods?\n",
    "    * Then instance methods would look like static methods, and there's nothing to differentiate between them.\n",

    "            * Touché... 🤔\n",

    "But the real reason why you put `self` in instance methods is because how instance methods are really called: `instance.instance_method()` translates to `Class.instance_method(instance)`. The instance is passed in for the `self` argument."

    "## Cheat: How to Make a Method Look Like an Attribute? `@property`\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how pandas DataFrame always seem to know the shape of itself despite a bunch of transformations that can make it fatter or taller? When you filter a DataFrames, does it could how know many rows it drops and update `.shape`? When a DataFrame adds more columns, does it update `.shape`? When a DataFrame performs groupby, does it update `.shape`? Nope--it's cheating!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Come cheat with me. Have you ever wondered what those fancy-schmancy people using `@property` are do? `@property` is a way to mask what is truly a method to appear like an attribute. There are 2 reasons to use `@property`:\n",
    "1. A property doesn't know its value until it's called--that's how it's lazy. For things that are slow to extract (like accessing a row from a database), you don't want an instance to load up all its attributes. Hence, a property is a Just-In-Time calculation to prevent slow instantiation. Optionally, once the value is extracted, then it can be stored into a \"private\" attribute. Since there are no real private attributes in Python, \"private\" just means an attribute that a user isn't supposed to touch.\n",
    "2. Hide the internal implementation such that you can keep a public-facing API but swap out the backend implementation.\n",

A `@property` actually has 3 components: getter, setter, and deleter. If you don't implement the setter, then the property is read-only--as there is no way to set the value. This is how you can create something that resembles a \"private\" attribute in Python. Try to comment out the setter to see that attempting to assign a value to the property will raise an exception. The deleter doesn't have a cool name; it is just deleter. It follows the same logic as the setter; without defining the deleter method, then the property cannot be deleted."

    "## Python's Data Model: (Magic) Methods All the Way Down\n",
    "Python's objects are really dictionaries. Even if `type(obj)` says `int` or `str`, the object is implemented with a dictionary, which holds all the methods, which are then accessed through magic methods, which are implemented by the Descriptor Protocol... Sorry, I lied to you: I'm not going to tell you about the Descriptor Protocol; it's just the low-level implementation detail that powers everything but is not important to know. The more useful thing is to understand methods, attributes, `@property`, and a few magic methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, everything is an object, all objects are really dictionaries underneath, and all useful things come from magic methods. When somebody facetiously says that \"Python is magic\", they are somewhat technically correct. Python's awesomeness is implemented via *magic methods*. So the next question naturally is what is a magic method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods are also called dunder methods since dunder means double underscore. The most familiar magic method is `__init__`, but there are dozens of them. The reason for magic methods isn't because they are truly magic or special--they are just regular methods that Python object's already have implemented. For example, whenever you call `len(obj)`, it is actually calling `obj.__len__()`. When you implement your own magic methods inside the class, you are replacing their default behavior with your own; this is called <i>method overriding</i>. When you are doing anything substantive in Python, you are actually triggering a bunch of magic method calls."

    "When you are writing a method in a child class with the same name as the parent class, you are using a technique called <i>method overriding</i> because the child class's method will take place of/supersede/override the parent class's method. The most common example of method overriding is `__init__()`. The parent class of all classes is `object` and its `__init__()` does nothing. That's why we method override `__init__()` in child classes, usually to set some instance attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Composition__: Creates `has-a` relationship. Basically, an instance of the \"composite\" class has attributes that are instances of \"component\" classes. That way the instances of the component class will themselves have methods, so the composite class does not need to inherit from parent class(es) to have useful methods. This notebook will not go over composition other than the below example. Composition vs inheritance is an open and heated debate, and some prefer composition over inheritance."

    "`super()` is used to make your child class's method use the parent class's method. Hence, overriding your parent's class's method in the child class does not mean the parent class's method is totally gone/lost--if you use `super()`. All you do in your child class's method definition is call `super()` which basically emulates an instance/object of the parent class instead of the child class--so now `super()` has access to all the parent class's methods. However, when using `super()`, you want to do something different instead of exactly the same as the parent class's method. If the child class's method is exactly the same as the parent class's method, then you would not need to method override the parent class's method in the first place. `super()` is used by the child class to *extend* the parent class's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a reason to extend a method in a real-world scenario. Suppose you wrote a bunch of code with a class called `WestworldHost` and it goes into production and everything is good. Now you want to upgrade the codebase but cannot change the source code because other people (who are also using `WestworldHost`) don't want it changed. What you can do is create a \"second-generation\" of that class where you inherit from the previous class but add more stuff to it. You can retain as much of the functionality that you like (without copying over code) and just replace the parts you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, extending a method using `super()` is like a decorator in that you are enhancing the original method (ie the parent class's method). The difference is that you don't pass in the original method to be decorated since you access the original method using `super()`. Perhaps decorators or extending a method with `super()` is the equivalent of inheritance for functions...? 🤔"

    "#### Advanced Inheritance Topics:\n",
    "There are fancy tricks with inheritance. Most times, you won't need them, so you can go along your day without worrying about them. Like a safety box, just know that they are there when you need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **multiple inheritance**: This occurs when a child class inherits from 2 parent classes simultaneously: `class C(A, B)`. Don't get multiple inheritance confused with serial inheritance (`class B(A): pass; class C(B): pass`), which is not multiple inheritance.\n",
    "    * **MRO**: (Daisy, is it you? No, it's **M**ethod **R**esolution **O**rder): MRO determines which parent's method will be called when a child instance calls a method defined in both the parent classes. For example, if class `C` inherits from classes `A` and `B` and both `A` and `B` have a method called `who_is_my_parent()`, then MRO will determine if an instance of `C` will use the method defined in `A` (`A.who_is_my_parent()`) vs method defined in `B` (`B.who_is_my_parent()`).  The specific algorithm used to determine MRO is called **C3 linearization**, which also resolves something called the \"diamond problem.\" Due to the sophistication of multiple inheritance, some programmers recommend against using it.\n",
    "* **mixin**: Something like a \"proto\" class in that mixins are regular classes that are not complete. You define a mixin class that has some functionality but is meant to be combined with other classes during multiple inheritance to make a final class you will actually want to use. An analogy is that you create a `Bun` mixin class and `Patty` mixin class--nobody would ever just eat an instance of only a bun or a patty. However, when you fuse them together through multiple inheritance, you can make a `Burger` class (`class Burger(Bun, Patty)`) that has attributes and methods of both bun and patty. Instances of the `Burger` class will be very useful and very tasty!\n",
    "* **abc/interface**: **A**bstract **B**ase **C**lass is where you define a fake class where the purpose is to figure out what the class will look like but not implement any of the methods. The abstract base class is like a template; you can define the method signatures but just put `pass` for the method body. Then, a real class inherits from the abstract base class and overrides all the methods. For example, `sklearn` has the estimator interface, which tells you to implement the `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods. The difference between *abc* and *interface* is very small.\n",
    "* **metaclass**: What is a class, an instance of? To make an analogy, an instance is to a class as a class is to a metaclass. A class's class is the metaclass--a metaclass can create classes. The default metaclass is `type`. Metaclasses are used to write frameworks when nothing else will do--very rare to use a metaclass, so a typical programmer will never have to use a metaclass. Don't worry about metaclasses. 😉\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced OOP Tricks\n",
    "* **alternative constructors/factory method**: have multiple ways to create instances of a class instead of solely `MyClass()`. This topic is covered in the section of this notebook called *Class Method as an Alternative Constructor*. For example, `datetime` instances can be created in multiple ways: `datetime(2020, 11, 5)`, `datetime.fromtimestamp(1604600000)`, `datetime.fromordinal(737734)`, `datetime.now()`. Alternative constructors are implemented by class methods in the class definition.\n",
    "* **factory method pattern**: Don't create the instances the normal way. Delegate it to a different class whose purpose is to figure which class is the suited for your needs and makes the instance of that class. *Factory method pattern* is different from *factory method*; the former can create instances of different classes at runtime whereas the latter  is only creating instances of its class. An example of factory method pattern is that given a person's gender, return an instance of `FootballPlayer` or `Gymnast`.\n",
    "* other special magic methods:\n",
    "    * `__new__()` is the true constructor, not `__init__()` (which is the initializer).\n",
    "    * `__del__()` (also called the finalizer) can be called during garbage collection but not guaranteed to be called. A better option than `__del__()` can be a context manager or making an explicit cleanup method (such as `release()`).\n",
    "* **name mangling**: having double underscores `__` as the prefix (but no underscores as the suffix) to a class/instance attribute changes the attribute name such that child class will not accidentally overwrite the parent class's attribute."
