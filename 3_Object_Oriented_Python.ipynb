    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boring, Academic Definition (Nobody Cares Except Professors and Pedantic, Technical Interviewers...):\n",
    "There are 4 fundamental tenets of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "* `Encapsulation`: hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.\n",
    "* `Inheritance`: class hierarchies improve code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.\n",
    "* `Abstraction`: deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.\n",
    "* `Polymorphism`: same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical, Real-time Importance:\n",
    "We get an object that has functions (called methods) attached to them. You can store and change/manipulate data (called attributes) using methods. If you are fancy, you can build complex objects through inheritance and composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask why is C considered a produceral language if it has `array` (like a list of homogenous elements) and `struct` (like a list of different types) data types. Aren't they \"objects\"? Well, OOP gives you objects AND methods that are built into the definition of the class. C uses (separately defined) functions to modify their data structures.  \n",
    "To the other extreme, you have Java where you only get objects--there are no function calls. Even print is a method: `System.out.println()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced (means fancy but often not very relevant) Topics:\n",
    "* `inheritance` (is-a relationship) vs `composition` (has-a relationship)\n",
    "* `parent class` (AKA superclass) and `child class` (AKA subclass), `super()` call\n",
    "* `multiple inheritance`, `MRO` (not Model Risk Officer! It's Method Resolution Order), `C3 linearization`\n",
    "* `metaclass`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/party_emoji.jpg\" width=70>\n",
    "#### Fun Fact Time!\n",
    "\n",
    "* `self` is not a special/reserved word in Python. In fact, you can use other words and it will still work. Extra Fun fact: JavaScripts equivalent of `self` is `this`. So... if you want to confuse people, you can use `this` instead of `self` ;-)"

    "In Python, it is said that \"everything is an object.\" What the pros (like yourself!) mean is that everything is an object/instance of a class. You ask what is a class a class of (tongue twister!)? A class is an instance of a metaclass (usually the metaclass is `type`). For example, even primitive types like numbers are an object, which have methods.\n",
