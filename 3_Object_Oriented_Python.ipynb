    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boring, Academic Definition (Nobody Cares Except Professors and Pedantic, Technical Interviewers...):\n",
    "There are 4 fundamental tenets of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "* `Encapsulation`: hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.\n",
    "* `Inheritance`: class hierarchies improve code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.\n",
    "* `Abstraction`: deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.\n",
    "* `Polymorphism`: same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical, Real-time Importance:\n",
    "We get an object that has functions (called methods) attached to them. You can store and change/manipulate data (called attributes) using methods. If you are fancy, you can build complex objects through inheritance and composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask why is C considered a produceral language if it has `array` (like a list of homogenous elements) and `struct` (like a list of different types) data types. Aren't they \"objects\"? Well, OOP gives you objects AND methods that are built into the definition of the class. C uses (separately defined) functions to modify their data structures.  \n",
    "To the other extreme, you have Java where you only get objects--there are no function calls. Even print is a method: `System.out.println()`  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Review: Practical OOP\n",
    "Everybody talks about Object Oriented Programming. Here's some actual useful functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lingo:\n",
    "* `class`: blueprints or definitions for creating an object. Another synonym for class is `type`.  \n",
    "* `object` (also called an instance): an actual, living, breathing creation of a `class`--the manifestation of building out what was in your blueprint. The process of creating an instance is called `instantiation`. A secondary definition is that everything (storable) in Python is an object. \n",
    "* `method`: a function you put inside a class.\n",
    "* `attribute`: a variable inside an instance (also called instance variable) or class (also called class variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a Python object has 4 things: a type/class, data/attributes, methods, and a unique identity (which can be found by calling `id()`). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Types (What an OOP pun!) of Methods:\n",
    "* `instance Method`: Most common (vast majority of time). Do something with the instance, ie update the instance's attributes or return something from that instance. Call from the instance.\n",
    "* `class method`: uncommon (maybe 10% of the time). Do something with the class, ie update the class's attributes or return something from that class. Call from the class or an instance.\n",
    "* `static method`: very uncommon (<5% of the time). Use no information about an instance or class, ie knows nothing about the instance or class. Just a regular function but you attached to a class (because it might be helpful). Call from the class or an instance."

    "## Cheat: How to Make a Method Look Like an Attribute? `@property`\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how pandas DataFrame always seem to know the shape of itself despite a bunch of transformations that can make it fatter or taller? When a DataFrames filters, does it could how know many rows it drops and update `.shape`? When a DataFrame adds more columns, does it update `.shape`? When a DataFrame performs groupby, does it update `.shape`? Nope--it's cheating!  \n",
    "\n",

    "Have you ever wondered what those fancy-schmancy people using `@property` are trying to do? `property` is the way to mask what is truly a method to appear like an attribute. There are 2 reasons to use `@property`:  \n",
    "1. A property doesn't know its value until it's called--that's how it's lazy. For things that are slow to extract (like accessing a row from a database), you don't want an instance to load up all its attributes. Hence, a property is a Just-In-Time calculation to prevent slow instantiation. Optionally, once the value is extracted, then it can be stored into a \"private\" attribute. Since there are no real private attributes in Python, \"private\" just means an attribute that a user isn't supposed to touch.   \n",

Even if `type(obj)` says `int` or `str`, the object is implemented with a dictionary, which holds all the methods and attributes, which are then accessed through magic methods, which are implemented by the Descriptor Protocol... Sorry, I lied to you: I'm not going to tell you about the Descriptor Protocol; it's just the low-level implementation detail that is not important to know. The more useful thing is to understand methods, attributes, `property`, and a few magic methods. \n",

The reason for magic methods isn't because they are truly magic or special--they are just regular methods that Python object's already have implemented. For example, whenever you call `len(object)`, it is actually calling `object.__len__()`. When you implement your own magic methods inside the class, you are replacing their default behavior with your own; this is called __method overriding__. When you are doing anything substantive in Python, you are actually triggering a bunch of magic method calls.  "

    "\n",
    "* __metaclass__: What is a class, a class of? A class is to an object as a metaclass is to a class. A class's class is the metaclass--a metaclass can create classes. The default metaclass is `type`. Metaclasses are used to write frameworks when nothing else will do--very rare to use a metaclass.  \n",
    "* __multiple inheritance__: This occurs when a child class inherits from 2 parent classes simultaneously: `class C(A, B)`. It is not serial inheritance, which is not multiple inheritance: `class B(A): pass; class C(B): pass`\n",
    "    * __MRO__: (Daisy, is it you? No, it's __M__ethod __R__esolution __O__rder): MRO determines which parent's method will be called when a child instance calls a method defined in both the parent classes. The specific algorithm is called __C3 linearization__.  \n",
    "* __mixin__: Something like a \"proto\" class in that mixins are regular classes that are not complete. You define a mixin class that has some functionality but is meant to be combined with other classes during multiple inheritance to make a final class you will actually want to use. An analogy is that you create a `Bun` mixin class and `Patty` mixin class--nobody would ever just eat an instance of only a bun or a patty. However, when you fuse them together through multiple inheritance, you can make a `Burger` class (`class Burger(Bun, Patty)`) that has aspects of both bun and patty. Instances of the `Burger` class will be very useful and very tasty!  \n",
    "* __abc/interface__: __A__bstract __B__ase __C__lass is where you define a fake class where the purpose is to figure out what the class will look like but not implement any of the methods. The abstract base class is like a template; you can define the method signatures but just put `pass` for the method body. Then, a real class inheritances from the abstract base class and overrides all the methods. For example, `sklearn` has the estimator interface, which tells you to implement the `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods. The difference between abc and interface is very small.  \n",

    "* special magic methods: \n",
    "    * `__new__()` is the true constructor, not `__init__()`, which is the initializer. \n",
    "    * `__del__()` can be called during garbage collection, but not guaranteed to be called.  \n",
    "* __name mangling__: `__` prefix in an class/instance attribute changes the attribute name such that child class will not accidentally overwrite the parent class's attribute.  \n",
    "* alternative constructors: have multiple ways to create instances of a class instead of solely `MyClass()`. For example, `datetime` instances can be created in multiple ways: `datetime(2013, 3, 16)`, `datetime.fromtimestamp(1363383616)`, `datetime.fromordinal(734000)`, `datetime.now()`. Alternative constructors are implemented by class methods in the class definition.  \n",
