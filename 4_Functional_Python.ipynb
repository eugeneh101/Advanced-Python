    "# Functional Programming\n",
    "Suppose you live in a world where you don't use classes (gasp!). Why in the world would you want to do that? The reason is that some problems are better suited when you don't mutate an underlying object. OOP uses attributes to not only keep state but mutate state. Because the statefulness of an object can be mutated, there are use cases where mutations hinders rather than helps: race conditions in threaded code, debugging complex mutations across multiple method calls, non-parallelizable so cannot distribute the computation, etc. Hence, some problems are better where you don't remember something about the object after it is used--it is stateless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming (often abbreviated as FP) treat objects as immutable and create new objects when needed--instead of mutating an object. An important nuance about FP is that it isn't about making things \"stateless\"; for example, there are still stateful things like variables and data structures (ie lists) in FP. FP is about preventing *mutating* state. In my opinion, FP tries to enforce a function as a single unit of transformation, making a function call atomic. Either a function succeeded in transforming the data or it didn't. You aren't supposed to inspect intermediate results--which is what you can do in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, I want to leave you with the idea that, in contrast to OOP, FP deliberately separates data and code. In FP, data is data and code (ie functions) is code. A procedural (or imperative) style tends to run data through code, store the result, run data through more code, etc--you are manipulating data. In constrast, a functional style tends to manipulate functions: construct more complex functions out of simpler functions (like Lego bricks) and then run data through the complex function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a boring, math professor who likes to think that CS is just applied math, then you probably think in terms of the textbook definitions of Functional Programming: a) **immutability**, b) **pure functions**, and **high-order functions**.\n",
    "* **Immutability**: nothing ever changes. What you put into a function, you get something else out. Stay the way you are--never change. Don't update yourself; transform into something new.\n",
    "* **Pure functions**: functions ideally should be completely deterministic in that given a specific input, the output will ALWAYS return the same output. In fact, nothing else should change at all; a __side effect__ is something that changes outside the scope of the function. Pure functions, by definition, cannot have a side effect. Sometimes, this constrant is too difficult, so the lesser constraint is `idempotency`: if something else changes (that is not the output), then something always changes in exactly same way--the side effect is deterministic.\n",
    "* **Higher-order functions**: since functions are first-class citizens in Python, what they means is that you can pass functions into functions. You can have a function return a function. You can define functions inside a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are very pedantic, you can say that Functional Programming is the implementation of *Lambda Calculus*, which is \"a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.\" This explains why FP style has a heavy \"mathy\" predisposition on approaching problems. (In fact, Python's `lambda` keyword, often used with FP's `map/filter/reduce`, comes from lambda calculus).\n",
    "\n",
    "But then again, do I *look* that old? Carpe diem! Let's go through some actual, fun examples of Functional Programming, so we can ditch the textbook answers. Books are for squares! Also, in this notebook we will be tempered in our approach to programming: when to use functional programming and when to mix functional programming with OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reader tip: FP is a denser style than other programming styles when you are just beginning. Feel free to read the sections you find interesting and skip the sections you are not interested in. You don't have to understand everything. A lot of these sections are included for *completeness* and are not necessary for a reader to understand in order to use the juicy bits of FP."

    "Decorators are introduced in `1_Pragmatic_Python.ipynb`. Nonetheless, here's a refresher on decorators: you have a function that you want to change some behavior before or after the function call. Basically you want to compose a function that alter the behavior of the original function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may be wondering: why would you want a decorator if you can just change the original function (if all you are going to do is change something before and/or after the original function call). The reason could be:\n",
    "* You can't change the original function because it is too complicated to understand.\n",
    "* You can't change the original function because you don't have access to change it. For example, many numpy functions are written in C, so you literally could not change the source code.\n",
    "* You can't change the original function because it is used everywhere and you don't know which ones you want to change.\n",
    "* You just wanna be ~~cool~~ a pro!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: be careful. A decorator is not exactly function composition. A decorator is not exactly f(g(x)) but something close. If you want to see a function composition example, then look towards the bottom of this notebook or just search for \"Function Composition\".\n",

    "\n",
    "### My Variables and I Need Some Closure\n",

Basically, `*args` is for a variable (and indeterminate) number of positional arguments and `**kwargs` is for a variable (and indeterminate) number of keyword arguments. Depending on where `*args`/`**kwargs` are used, they can either separate out the arguments or gather them together. If they are used at function call time, then `*args` and `**kwargs` will separate your list/tuple or dictionary of arguments correctly into the function's arguments. If you are using them at function definition time, then they will gather your arguments into a tuple or dictionary.  \n",

You can have multiple base cases. Generally, you put the base case at the top of the function's body.\n",

The reason is that suppose you wrote your recursion wrong and it never hits the base case, then the function keeps call itself infinitely--I guess you can call FP's infinite recursion as analogous to procedural programming's infinite `while` loop (where the loop is always true and can never execute the loop). To guard against that, Python has a maximum call stack depth, which limits how many nested function calls you can do. The call stack is made out of a stack frames, one for each nested function call.\n",

Once your function hits the base case, the result is discovered, which passes result to the function call (the one before/below in the call stack) that created this stack frame. Thus, the call stack \"pops\" off the stack frame that is resolved, so the stack is decreasing. Once the stack frame hits the bottom, your 1st function call returns you the actual result.  \n",

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "If you come from OOP, then closures in FP are a poor man's objects. If you come from FP, then objects/classes in OOP are a poor man's closure. In a way, you can think of decorators as the FP version of inheritance in OOP: you extend/modify/override the behavior of the original function. The point is not to select a universal programming paradigm that you apply to everything. If you are given a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. Always keep in mind the Golden Rule of programming: **use the best tool for the problem.** Select between OOP and FP (and other styles) depending on how you think is best to attack the problem. Perhaps a less eloquent and more blunt way of saying this is: don't hurt yourself. Don't contort yourself with the mental gymnastics of fitting the problem into a fixed style; incorporate multiple styles to address the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rough rule of thumb is that data transformation *can be* more suited for FP design if  you don't need to remember (intermediate) state--in this case, it is more about the function purity. Things that need state or updates states (ike a UI design or database stuff) are more suited for OOP. OOP and FP are not polar opposites or mutually exclusive paradigms. A class's static method is like a compromise between FP and OOP. For example, a static method does not read or write the state of the instance (ie instance attributes) and is totally reliant on the inputted arguments. But a static method does not guarantee purity since it can still mutate a global variable. A static method uses OOP syntax because it is attached to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you can fuse OOP and FP to get the best of both worlds; a practical use case is high-performance frameworks (Apache Spark, Apache Beam, Dask [dataframe, bag, array], Ray) and graph-based engines (TensorFlow, Airflow, Prefect, Dask [delayed]).  For example since `map` and `filter` should use pure functions, they are easily parallelizable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly parallelizable operations are ones where a transformation on 1 element is not dependent on another element and thus are called **Embarrassingly Parallel** problems. For example, word count is an example of a (mostly) embarrassingly parallel problem since you can count the words on different pages of a book using different processes (embarrassingly parallel) and then add up the intermediate results (not embarrassingly parallel) at the end to get the final answer. Guess what the next section is on? High-performance Python! ⚡"
