    "# Functional Programming\n",
    "Suppose you have a world where you don't use classes (gasp!). Why in the world would you want to do that? The reason is that some problems are better suited when you don't mutate an underlying object. Because attributes of an object keeps statefulness of something, there are use cases where state hinders than helps: race conditions in threaded code, debugging complex mutations across multiple method calls, . However, some problems are better where you don't remember something about the instance after it is used--it is stateless. In Functional Programming, it's better to just create a new object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a boring, math professor who likes to think that CS is just applied math, then you probably think in terms of the textbook definitions of Functional Programming (often abbreviated as FP): a) __immutability__, b) __pure functions__, and __high-order functions__.  \n",
    "* __Immutability__: nothing ever changes. What you put into a function, you get something else out. Stay the way you are--never change. Don't update yourself; transform into something new.  \n",
    "* __Pure functions__: functions ideally should be completely deterministic in that given a specific input, the output will ALWAYS return the same output. In fact, nothing else should change at all; a __side effect__ is something that changes outside the scope of the function. Pure functions, by definition, cannot have a side effect. Sometimes, this constrant is too different, so the lesser constraint is `idempotency`: if something else changes (that is not the output), then something always changes in exactly same way--the side effect is deterministic.  \n",
    "* __Higher-order functions__: since functions are first-class citizens in Python, what they means is that you can pass functions into functions. You can have a function return a function. You can define functions inside a function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But then again, do I <i>look</i> that old? Carpe diem! Let's go through some actual, fun examples of Functional Programming, so we can ditch the textbook answers. Books are for squares! Also, in this notebook we will be tempered in our approach to programming: when to use functional programming and when to mix functional programming with OOP.  \n",

    "## `map`/`filter`/`reduce`\n",
    "List comprehensions are generally the \"Pythonic\" way to do things. Let's try to do the same using FP syntax.  A list comprehension can do both `map` and `filter` and the reverse is true: all list comprehensions are a composition of `map` and `filter`. Instead of updating/modifying a list, just return a new one."
