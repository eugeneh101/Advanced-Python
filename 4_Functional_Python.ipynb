    "# Functional Programming\n",
    "Suppose you live in a world where you don't use classes (gasp!). Why in the world would you want to do that? The reason is that some problems are better suited when you don't mutate an underlying object. OOP uses attributes to not only keep state but mutate state. Because the statefulness of an object can be mutated, there are use cases where mutations hinders rather than helps: race conditions in threaded code, debugging complex mutations across multiple method calls, non-parallelizable so cannot distribute the computation, etc. Hence, some problems are better where you don't remember something about the object after it is used--it is stateless.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming (often abbreviated as FP) treat objects as immutable and create new objects when needed--instead of mutating an object. An important nuance about FP is that it isn't about making things \"stateless\"; for example, there are still stateful things like variables and data structures (ie lists) in FP. FP is about preventing <i>mutating</i> state. In my opinion, FP tries to enforce a function as a single unit of transformation, making a function call atomic. Either a function succeeded in transforming the data or it didn't. You aren't supposed to inspect intermediate results--which is what you can do in OOP.   \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, I want to leave you with the idea that, in contrast to OOP, FP deliberately separates data and code. In FP, data is data and code (ie functions) is code. A procedural (or imperative) style tends to run data through code, store the result, run data through more code, etc--you are manipulating data. In constrast, a functional style tends to manipulate functions: construct more complex functions out of simpler functions (like Lego bricks) and then run data through the complex function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a boring, math professor who likes to think that CS is just applied math, then you probably think in terms of the textbook definitions of Functional Programming: a) __immutability__, b) __pure functions__, and __high-order functions__.  \n",
    "* __Immutability__: nothing ever changes. What you put into a function, you get something else out. Stay the way you are--never change. Don't update yourself; transform into something new.  \n",
    "* __Pure functions__: functions ideally should be completely deterministic in that given a specific input, the output will ALWAYS return the same output. In fact, nothing else should change at all; a __side effect__ is something that changes outside the scope of the function. Pure functions, by definition, cannot have a side effect. Sometimes, this constrant is too difficult, so the lesser constraint is `idempotency`: if something else changes (that is not the output), then something always changes in exactly same way--the side effect is deterministic.  \n",
    "* __Higher-order functions__: since functions are first-class citizens in Python, what they means is that you can pass functions into functions. You can have a function return a function. You can define functions inside a function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are very pedantic, you can say that Functional Programming is the implementation of <i>Lambda Calculus</i>, which is \"a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.\" This explains why FP style has a heavy \"mathy\" predisposition on approaching problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But then again, do I <i>look</i> that old? Carpe diem! Let's go through some actual, fun examples of Functional Programming, so we can ditch the textbook answers. Books are for squares! Also, in this notebook we will be tempered in our approach to programming: when to use functional programming and when to mix functional programming with OOP.  "

    "## `map`/`filter`/`reduce`\n",
    "List comprehensions are generally the \"Pythonic\" way to do things. Let's try to do the same using FP syntax.  A list comprehension can do both `map` and `filter` and the reverse is true: all list comprehensions are a combination of `map` and `filter`. Instead of updating/modifying a list, just return a new one. FP does <i>not</i> use loops; instead FP uses `map`/`filter`/`reduce` (and recursion) to achieve the same results as loops. Also remember the added bonus is that `map` and `filter` are lazy (do not immediately execute so saves on runtime) and uses low memory footprint. `reduce` is eagerly/immediately executed but also uses low memory footprint.

Also, a pure function does not mutate the state of things outside of its scope--ie no side effects. Pure functions are easier to reason about and test because they only do 1 thing and are totally decoupled between function calls. Nothing about the last function call is remembered--thus is stateless.  \n",

    "## Music to My Ears: Decorate and Compose\n",
    "Decorators are introduced in `1_Pragmatic_Python.ipynb`. Nonetheless, here's a refresher on decorators: you have a function that you want to change some behavior before or after the function call. Basically you want to compose a function that alter the behavior of the original function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may be wondering: why would you want a decorator if you can just change the original function (if all you are going to do is change something before and/or after the original function call). The reason could be:  \n",
    "* You can't change the original function because it is too complicated to understand.  \n",
    "* You can't change the original function because you don't have access to change it. For example, many numpy functions are written in C, so you literally could not change the source code.  \n",
    "* You can't change the original function because it is used everywhere and you don't know which ones you want to change.  \n",
    "* You just wanna be ~~cool~~ a pro!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: be careful. A decorator is not exactly function composition. A decorator is not exactly f(g(x)) but something close. If you want to see a function composition example, then look towards the bottom of this notebook or just search for \"Function Composition\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Variables and I Need Some Closure\n",
    "Quick thing. A decorator is closure. Closure is a function that has access to variable(s) defined <i>outside</i> of the function. Closure is called closure since it has access to variables that are not locally defined, which are \"closed over\" by the closure function. This academic definition is confusing even though the idea is actually quite simple. Here's a simple example.  "

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "If you come from OOP, then closures in FP are a poor man's objects. If you come from FP, then objects/classes in OOP are a poor man's closure. In some way, you can think of decorators as the FP version of inheritance in OOP: you extend/modify/override the behavior of the original function. The point is not to select a universal programming paradigm that you apply to everything. If you are given a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. Always keep in mind the Golden Rule of programming: <b> use the best tool for the problem.</b> Select between OOP and FP (and other styles) depending on how you think is best to attack the problem. A rough rule of thumb is that data transformation <i>can be</i> more suited for FP design if  you don't need to remember (intermediate) state--in this case, it is more about the function purity. Things that need state or updates states (ike a UI design or database stuff) is more suited for OOP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP and FP are not polar opposites or mutually exclusive paradigms. A class's static method is like a compromise between FP and OOP. For example, a static method does not read or write the state of the instance (ie instance attributes) and is totally reliant on the inputted arguments. But a static method does not guarantee purity since it can still mutate a global variable. A static method uses OOP syntax because it is attached to a class.  \n",

    "Sometimes you can fuse OOP and FP to get the best of both worlds; a practical use case is high-performance frameworks (Apache Spark, Apache Beam, Dask [dataframe, bag, array], Ray) and graph-based engines (TensorFlow, Airflow, Prefect, Dask [delayed]).  For example since `map` and `filter` should use pure functions, they are easily parallelizable operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Highly parallelizable operations are ones where a transformation on 1 element is not dependent on another element and thus are called __Embarrassingly Parallel__ problems. For example, word count is an example of a (mostly) embarrassingly parallel problem since you can count the words on different pages of a book using different processes (embarrassingly parallel) and then add up the intermediate results (not embarrassingly parallel) at the end to get the final answer. Guess what the next section is on? High-performance Python! ⚡  "
