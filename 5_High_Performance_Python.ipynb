    "ZOMG! Scala's functional API is awesome and stands on the shoulders of the JVM. Go(lang) has goroutines that beats the pants off of Python's multithreading. Rust--I don't know what it does but it sounds trendy. 🙄 \n",

    "Spare me the faux concern ~~you pretentious C++ developer~~ ... I mean good question! Python supports rapid speed of development and experimentation, expressiveness and conciseness of syntax, and high-performance frameworks for speed. At a high-level, speed up Python performance on 1 machine using vectorization, multi-threading, multi-processing, and asynchronous programming. On multiple machines, you have cluster/distributed computing frameworks: Apache Spark, Dask, Apache Beam, Ray, and others. On cloud services, you have containers and scalable, serverless computing. In this tutorial, I will show you various ways to make Python fast and scalable, so performance is not your bottleneck.  "

    "## Debunking the \"Slow\" Python Myth\n",
    "What do you mean by slow? Do you mean that Python runs slow, so it would cost more money when renting EC2s?  \n",
    "Remember that compute time is cheap and developer time is relatively expensive. Suppose a standard laptop has 4 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM. The equivalent EC2 instance on AWS rents for just \\\\$0.154 per hour; an engineer costs \\\\$50 per hour. So for each hour of developer time you waste, you could have rented a machine for 300 hours--or you can rent 300 machines for 1 hour. A 40 hour week for on EC2 would be \\$6--cheaper than your daily lunch!  \n",
    "Some \"faster\" languages are notoriously verbose, so you end up with pages and pages of code. Python's ease of use and expressivenes gives you a super power: rapid speed of development, which gives you a second super power: the ability to beat your competition to the market. Way of the Pro! Rapid experimentation allows you to out-maneuver your competition with better and newer features. Python's readability offers maintainability since developers come and go. Basically, can you write your code faster than somebody else: can you do something in 1 hour that somebody else takes 5?  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need speed, Guido recommends you delegate the performance critical part to Cython:  \n",
    "```\"At some point, you end up with one little piece of your system, as a whole, where you end up spending all your time. If you write that just as a sort of simple-minded Python loop, at some point you will see that that is the bottleneck in your system. It is usually much more effective to take that one piece and replace that one function or module with a little bit of code you wrote in C or C++ rather than rewriting your entire system in a faster language, because for most of what you're doing, the speed of the language is irrelevant.\" --Guido van Rossum```  \n",
    "I won't mention Cython in the tutorial since it is rarely ever used--I have never personally met anybody who wrote their custom Cython code. Things that need to be performant in Python are already written in Cython: numpy, XGBoost, SpaCy, etc. The high level idea for Cython is that Python is actually written on top of C, so for speed you can write directly in C (or C++) and import it to Python.  \n",

    "If you are concerned about speed, do you know what is faster than Python? Fortran.  Then you can brush up on your Fortran to get hired by ... nobody (or worse, mainframe specialists 🤢).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Speed of the language primarily helps with CPU bound problems and not IO bound problems--in IO bound problems, any programming language will perform roughly the same since the majority of the time, you are waiting for a network response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you don't really care about the raw speed of a language. You care about the expressioness and functionality of the language: its ecosystem, user-base, and mindshare. Whatever problem you can think of, Python probably has a library for that. Which you can pip install. So you can write minimal code. With which you solve your problem. So you can call it a day. Like Newton, when you use Python, you stand on the shoulders of giants. Things just work!

Sometimes, you can consider a tradeoff between space and time requirements. For example, if you are using a list and often have to append to the front and the end of the list, then you are better off with a data structure called double-ended queue (AKA deque). A deque have rapid `append()` and `appendleft()` methods as well as `pop()` and `popleft()`, since these operations are all O(1). However, a deque has slow access to the ith element, which is now a O(n) operation. You have to figure out which data structure gives you the best benefit given tradeoffs/constraints."

However, if you multithread, IO tasks release the GIL, so you can scrap multiple urls \"at the same time.\" Really, the bulk of the time is waiting for the response of data from the url (as any CPU time is virtually instantaneous), so multithreading can shrink that runtime significantly. Remember, you are still just using 1 CPU. Scraping websites does not take a lot of CPU power. Heavy number crunching is called *CPU bound* tasks, and multithreading does not help--and in fact, will be slower than serial execution.\n",

Imagine if you are the CPU and are multi-tasking multiple threads, you can be making a phone call, responding to an email, watching TV.

    "Finally, threads are *not* scalable. The scheduling of the threads (ie, which one comes next) is actually done by the OS, so although a couple milliseconds seems fast to humans, it is still slow. Computers operate at the nanosecond level (billions of operations per second). Switching between threads is called **context switching**. When there are a lot of threads (say 30), then the OS has to pick which thread out of the 30 runs next. In this case, more time is spent acquiring the GIL than actually doing work. It's like the Hunger Games of threads--may the odds be ever in your favor in acquiring the GIL. In this case, it might be better to use serial execution (for loop) compared to using 30 threads.\n",

    "How do you get true parallelism (ie multiple things running at the *exact* same time)? You use multiple processes (multiprocessing), so there is no context switching and no problems with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Each (sub)process is basically a separate Python process/kernel (with its own GIL) and can run on a different CPU--this is scheduled by the OS, so you don't need to do it yourself. You can think of multiprocessing as being able to create multiple Python (sub)processes (say 10) with very little code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is very good for \"embarrassingly parallel\" problems, which can be subdivided and worked on separately \n",
    "and independently. If you want to see the predicted speedup of using multiprocessing, you can look at [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), which is a formula about how much faster will multiprocessing be over regular ol' serial loops. Multiprocessing is not so good where the results of A depend on results of B, which depend on results of C. For example, multiprocessing is good for running many simulations, but it would not be good for something sequential like withdrawals from a bank account (because you want to know when the bank account runs out of money).\n",
    "\n",
    "A downside of multiprocessing is that each process has separate memory, not shared memory (which multithreading has). Hence, processes generally don't talk to each other. Communication is still possible through IPC (inter-process communication) or RPC (remote process communication), but these are not (explicitly) used often. The other small downside is the start up time for a new process--it takes on the order of 100 milliseconds whereas a new thread can be started much faster. But a 100 millisecond is approximately a blink of an eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, you can think of multiprocessing as distributed functional programming because you are using `map()` over an iterable and the process pool will send each element of the iterable to a process. The process will apply the function onto the element and then return the result back to you.\n",

I used 1 large machine (64 CPUs and 256 GB of RAM). The ETL job was to parse compressed zip files, perform some data transformation, and store into a database. In fact, my Python code was so performant that the machine running Python was only at ~50% CPU utilization but all the servers running NoSQL (HBase) were all maxed out at 100% CPU utilization. NoSQL is known for its rapid read and write speeds, so actually it was quite surprising that the NoSQL was the bounding constraint and not Python. This is a case study of Python being very performant and doing distributed, parallel computation.\n",

Suppose you have 4 processes and the iterable is `range(40)` and `chunksize=5`, then elements 1,2,3,4,5 will be sent to 1 process and 6,7,8,9,10 will be sent to another process, etc. By default, chunksize=1.\n",

This is helpful in a long running job if you believe there might be a memory leak where the RAM utilization keeps increasing over time. By setting a small `maxtasksperchild`, then even if there is a small memory leak, the processs will be restarted to replace the previous process, so you won't hit your RAM ceiling. By default, maxtasksperchild=float(\"inf\"), so the same processes are used for all the elements of the iterable (ie there are no new processes that replace the old ones).\n",

    "These things are not built in a vacuum: progress stands on the shoulders of giants. Their histories are intertwined. Spark is basically mapreduce but in memory for the speed. Apache Beam originated from Google's internal Millwheel project and was marketed as true streaming. Spark basically copied Beam's approach. Dask was created originally for distributed arrays because Spark doesn't support it. Ray uses Redis and was probably inspired by Akka (framework in Scala). Dask adopted Ray's actor model. Basically copy ideas that work and dump the rest. A lot of frameworks that don't make the cut and just fade out. Other frameworks: Apache Apex (dead), Apache Gearpump (basically dead), Apache Samza (~~lame~~ only Java), Apache Flink (seems like a Hadoop thing, so basically for legacy applications)  "

One of the clients I worked on is such an old-boys club that they still buy hardware, explain story.  \n",
