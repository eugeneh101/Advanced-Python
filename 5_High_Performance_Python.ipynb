    "# High-Performance Python\n",
    "Once in awhile, you will hear that \"oh Python is so slow or not performant enough\" or \"Python is not for <i>enterprise</i> use cases since it is not fast enough\" or \"Python is a language for script kiddies and at best \"glue\" code.\"  \n",
    "ZOMG! Scala's functional API is awesome and stands on the shoulders of the JVM. Go(lang) has goroutines that beats the pants off of Python's multithreading. Rust--I don't know what it does but it sounds trendy. ðŸ™„ \n",
    "\n",
    "Spare me the faux concern ~~you snivelling C++ developer~~ ... I mean good question! Python supports rapid speed of development and experimentation, expressiveness and conciseness of syntax, and high-performance frameworks for speed. At a high-level, speed up Python performance on 1 machine using vectorization, multi-threading, multi-processing, and asynchronous programming. On multiple machines, you have cluster/distributed computing frameworks: Apache Spark, Dask, Apache Beam, Ray, and others. On cloud services, you have containers and scalable, serverless computing. In this tutorial, I will show you various ways to make Python fast and scalable, so performance is not your bottleneck.  "

    "# Debunking the \"Slow\" Python Myth\n",
    "What do you mean by slow? Do you mean that Python runs slow, so it would cost more money when renting EC2s?  \n",
    "Remember that compute time is cheap and developer time is relatively expensive. Suppose a standard laptop has 4 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM. An EC2 instance on AWS rents for just \\$0.154 per hour; an engineer costs $50 per hour. So for each hour of developer time you waste, you could have rented a machine for 300 hours--or you can rent 300 machines for 1 hour. A 40 hour week for on EC2 would be \\$6--cheaper than your daily lunch!  \n",
    "Some \"faster\" languages are notoriously verbose, so you end up with pages and pages of code. Python's ease of use and expressivenes gives you the super power: rapid speed of development gives you the ability to beat your competition to the market. Rapid experimentation allows you to out-maneuver your competition with better and newer features. Python's readability offers maintainability since developers come and go. Basically, can you write your code faster than somebody else: can you do in 1 hour that somebody else takes 5?  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need speed, Guido recommends you delegate the performance critical part to Cython:  \n",
    "```\"At some point, you end up with one little piece of your system, as a whole, where you end up spending all your time. If you write that just as a sort of simple-minded Python loop, at some point you will see that that is the bottleneck in your system. It is usually much more effective to take that one piece and replace that one function or module with a little bit of code you wrote in C or C++ rather than rewriting your entire system in a faster language, because for most of what you're doing, the speed of the language is irrelevant.\" --Guido van Rossum```  \n",
    "I won't mention Cython in the tutorial since it is rarely ever used--I have never personally met anybody who wrote their custom Cython code. Things that need to be performant in Python are already written in Cython: numpy, XGBoost, SpaCy, etc. The high level idea for Cython is that Python is actually written on top of C, so for speed you can write directly in C (or C++) and import it to Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are concerned about speed, do you know what is faster than Python? Fortran.  Then you can brush up on your Fortran to get hired by ... nobody (or worse, mainframe specialists ðŸ¤¢).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Speed of the language primarily helps with CPU bound problems and not IO bound problems--in IO bound problems, any programming language will perform roughly the same since the majority of the time, you are waiting for a network response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you don't really care about the raw speed of a language. You care about the expressioness and functionality of the language: its ecosystem, user-base, and mindshare. Whatever problem you can think of, Python probably has a library for that. Which you can pip install. Which you can write minimal code. With which you solve your problem. So you can call it a day. Like Newton, when you use Python, you stand on the shoulders of giants. Things just work! Imagine if you couldn't just import sklearn and run Random Forest but had to write your own random forest algorithm. Actually, don't...  \n",
