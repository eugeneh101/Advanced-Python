So for each hour of developer time you waste, you could have rented a machine for 300 hours--or you can rent 300 machines for 1 hour. A 40 hour week for on EC2 would be \\$6--cheaper than your daily lunch!\n",

Things that need to be performant in Python are already written in Cython: numpy, XGBoost, SpaCy, etc. The high level idea for Cython is that Python is actually written on top of C, so for speed you can write directly in C (or C++) and import it to Python.  \n",

    "For example, if you are using a list and often have to append to the front and the end of the list, then you are better off with a data structure called __deque__, a double-ended queue. A deque has rapid `append()` and `appendleft()` methods as well as `pop()` and `popleft()`, since these operations are all O(1). However, a deque has slow access to the ith element, which is now a O(n) operation. You have to figure out which data structure gives you the best benefit, given its tradeoffs/constraints."

So why would you use multithreading instead of regular ol' serial execution (ie for loop)?\n",

However, if you multithread, IO tasks release the GIL, so you can scrap multiple urls \"at the same time.\" Really, the bulk of the time is waiting for the response of data from the url (as any CPU time is virtually instantaneous), so multithreading can shrink that runtime significantly. \n",

You use multiple processes (multiprocessing), so there is no context switching and no problems with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Each (sub)process is basically a separate Python process/kernel (with its own GIL) and can run on a different CPU--this is scheduled by the OS, so you don't need to do it yourself. You can think of multiprocessing as being able to create multiple Python (sub)processes (say 10) with very little code.\n",

If you want to see the predicted speedup of using multiprocessing, you can look at [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), which is a formula about how much faster will multiprocessing be over regular ol' serial loops. Multiprocessing is not so good where the results of A depend on results of B, which depend on results of C. For example, multiprocessing is good for running many simulations, but it would not be good for something sequential like withdrawals from a bank account (because you want to know when the bank account runs out of money).\n",

    "A downside of multiprocessing is that each process has separate memory, not shared memory (which multithreading has). Hence, processes generally don't talk to each other. Communication is still possible through IPC (interprocess communication) or RPC (remote process communication), but these are not (explicitly) used often. The other small downside is the start up time for a new process--it takes on the order of 100 milliseconds whereas a new thread can be started much faster. But 100 milliseconds is only (approximately) a blink of an eye.\n",

    "At a high level, you can think of multiprocessing as distributed functional programming because you are using `map()` over an iterable and the process pool will send each element of the iterable to a process.

I used 1 large machine (64 CPUs and 256 GB of RAM). The ETL job was to parse compressed zip files, perform some data transformation, and store into a database. In fact, my Python code was so performant that the machine running Python was only at ~50% CPU utilization, but all the servers running NoSQL (HBase) were all maxed out at 100% CPU utilization. NoSQL is known for its rapid read and write speeds, so it was actually quite surprising that the NoSQL was the bounding constraint and not Python. This is a case study of Python being very performant and doing distributed, parallel computation.\n",

By setting a small `maxtasksperchild`, then even if there is a small memory leak, the processs will be restarted to replace the previous process, so you won't hit your RAM ceiling.

    "## (unfinished) Distributed Computing Frameworks\n",
    "In some sense, distributed computing (i.e. *parallel computing* or *high-performance computing*) is glorified multiprocessing. Basically, distributed computing aims to *distribute* workloads horizontally instead of vertically. Horizontally scaling means using lots of small or medium-sized machines to do the work. Vertically scaling means using one very large machine (with lots of RAM and CPU). Horizontal scaling is preferable because medium-sized machines are commodities--very easy to get access to and are cheap. Large machines are very expensive and sometimes an instance that large is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like multiprocessing, distributed computing works very well with \"embarrassingly parallel\" problems, which are problems that can be subdivided and worked on separately and independently. Fortunately, distributed computing frameworks can coordinate between the worker machines to aggregate results, which is not an embarrassingly parallel task. Take a look at [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), which gives a formula about predicted speedup vs running a regular loop. A common lesson of distributed computing is that it isn’t about doing one thing exceedingly well; it’s about doing nothing poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, distributed computing frameworks are glorified `map`/`filter`/`reduce` operations. Basically you want to chain a bunch of transformations together. If you have just one transformation, you might be better off with just `multiprocessing`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In distributed computing, you have a lot of elements (basically a list where the elements are distributed over multiple machines) and then you want to do one thing to it, get the outputted list, and then do another thing to that outputted list. Often the transformations are written using functional programming syntax and applied lazily, so they don't use memory or CPUs until you want to trigger the actual computation. Basically the purpose of the previous notebook (4_Functional_Python.ipynb) was to get you familiar with functional programming syntax, so you can use distributed computing frameworks.\n",

    "These things are not built in a vacuum: progress stands on the shoulders of giants. Their histories are intertwined. Spark is basically mapreduce but in memory for the speed. Apache Beam originated from Google's internal Millwheel project and was marketed as true streaming. Spark basically copied Beam's approach. Dask was created originally for distributed arrays because Spark doesn't support it. Ray uses Redis and was probably inspired by Akka (framework in Scala). Dask adopted Ray's actor model. Basically copy ideas that work and dump the rest. A lot of frameworks that don't make the cut and just fade out. Other frameworks: Apache Apex (dead), Apache Gearpump (basically dead), Apache Samza (~~lame~~ only Java), Apache Flink (seems like a Hadoop thing, so basically for legacy applications)  "
