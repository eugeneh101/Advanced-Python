    "## Name Binding (What You Think of as Assignment)\n",
    "Whenever you use assignment (=), you can think about it as putting a name tag onto the data--this is called name binding. You can use the `id()` function to see the object's memory address. Hence, for the duration of the object's existence (ie not deleted), the id will be unique and unchanged. Python's assigment (=) NEVER copies data--it merely puts another name tag on the same object. The `is` keyword in Python is highly related to `id()` in that `is` detects whether the identity of 2 objects are the same--if the 2 variables are pointing to same memory address. If `x is y` is True, then `id(x) == id(y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reference Counting\n",
    "If you want to see how many name tags are attached to the same object, then use `sys.getrefcout`. Python internally has a reference count for every object--once the reference count goes to 0, then the object is deleted from memory. Deleting a variable will remove the name tag. Python's `del` statement doesn't directly delete a variable. Instead `del` deletes the name binding (the name tag) onto the object. Once an object's reference count goes to 0, then Python's garbage collector will finally remove the object from memory. In short, `del` statement indirectly deletes an object.   \n",
    "There's a fine print in the documentation: ```The count returned is generally one higher than you might expect, because it includes the (temporary) reference as an argument to getrefcount().```  "

    "`or` and `and` have a cool functionality called <i>short circuting</i> in that they do not have to evaluate all expressions. Short circuiting is similar to lazy evaluation in that not all expressions are executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`or` executes the left-hand side first, and if the left-side expression is logically `True`, then `or` will not evaluate the right-hand argument. Only if the left-hand side is logically `False`, then evaluate the right-hand side. Hence, `or` executes expressions from left to right and stops at the first logically `True` expression. If all expressions are logically `False`, then you get the last expression. \n",
    "* Logically `False` objects: `False`, `None`, 0, empty string `\"\"`, empty tuple `()`, empty list `[]`, empty dict `{}`, empty set `set()`  \n",
    "* Logically `True` objects: pretty much anything else. Even `(0,)` or `[None]` is truthy because they are non-empty containers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `any()` is very similar to `or`. `any()` returns `True` or `False` by iterating your object and checking the truthiness of every element. If any of the elements is logically `True`, then it will return `True`. Otherwise, return `False` since all elements are logically `False`. Note, if you iterate over an empty container, then `any()` will return `False`."

    "## (Extra) Fun Facts/Pedantic Details About 🐍\n",
    "Here are some things you can keep in your mind just for fun ✨. It is not very important to know (unless you want to argue with your friends about <i>pedantic</i> details like a <i>real</i> computer scientist! Ya know, like a pro...).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specification vs Implementation\n",
    "Often when we think of Python, we are really thinking of CPython. \"Python\" is really a specification--a blueprint/whitepaper for what the syntax and features should be. A specification has no code; it is an idea. An implementation is the actual code that builds and brings the specification into real life. There are multiple implementations of Python:  \n",
    "* CPython: the most common one that most people use, implemented in C\n",
    "* PyPy: Python implemented in (restricted) Python\n",
    "* Jython: implemented in Java, so can interoperate with Java classes and libraries\n",
    "* IronPython: implemented in C#, so can interoperate with C#/CLR/.NET classes and libraries  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretated vs Compiled\n",
    "We often hear that Python is an interpreted language. What does that mean?  \n",
    "An interpreted language executes the source code 1 line at a time. A compiled language \"compiles\" the entire source code file into machine code that is native to the hardware--hence your original code is translated into something non-human-readable but faster for the machine to process. Hence compiled languages like C tend to be faster than interpreted languages.  \n",
    "Do note that a language's <i>specification</i> is not compiled nor interpreted. It is the <i>implementation</i> that is compiled or interpreted. The main implementation of Python is CPython, which is interpreted: the bytecode is interpreted line-by-line by the Python Virtual Machine (often simply referred to as the Python interpreter). If you want to see a function's bytecode, you can use Python's dissambler module called `dis` to see what steps your function actually consists of.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamically Typed vs Statically Typed\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. What does that mean?  \n",
    "Early programming languages tended to be statically typed. This means you have to declare a variables along with its type, so that variable's type is known at all times and type errors can be determined at compile time. For example, in C you would write `int c = 42` and that variable would stay an integer. Hence, the code becomes more verbose.  \n",
    "Dynamically typed languages allow a variable to change types. For example, in Python you can write `x = 42` and in the next line `x = \"42\"`--this is not possible in a statically typed language. In Python, you don't declare a variable's type, so code tends to be more succinct. However, type errors are discovered in runtime. For example, can you add 10 to `x`? Python doesn't know until it runs that line of code.  \n",
    "One big advantage of interpreted languages is that you get an <i>interactive prompt</i> where you can run things 1 line at a time. This read-eval-print loop is called REPL and is very handy for quick-and-dirty code or debugging.  \n",
    "Python is a duck typed language, which is a special case of dynamic typed language. Basically, you can call a method on object without knowing its class. For example, you can run `x.pop()` and at runtime it will either run it successfully or give you an error because Python doesn't know until runtime if `x` is an instance of a class that has defined a `.pop()` method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strongly Typed vs Weakly Typed\n",
    "Python is a strongly typed language. What does that mean?  \n",
    "A strongly typed language will not automatically convert an objects type. For example, in Python, you cannot do `\"2\" + 8`. Why would you ever want to do that?  \n",
    "I don't know, but you CAN do that in a weakly typed language, which will automatically convert 1 type to another. In JavaScript, you can do the following horrendous things. <i>Wat</i>?\n",
    "* `[] + {}` -> `[object Object]`\n",
    "* `{} + []` -> 0\n",
    "* `\"wat\" - 1` -> \"wat1\"\n",
    "* `\"wat\" - 1` -> `NaN`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pass by Object\n",
    "Often there is a question of whether Python is `pass by value` or `pass by reference`. The answer is neither: Python is `pass by object`.  \n",
    "* <i>Pass by value</i> is when in a function call, the variable is copied over, so there are 2 things with the same data. R is pass by value--that means when you pass a dataframe into a function, the dataframe is copied. If you mutate the dataframe inside an R function, nothing will happen to the original dataframe.  \n",
    "* <i>Pass by reference</i> is that you pass in a memory address (a pointer) as the argument to the function, so if you change the variable <i>inside</i> the function call, then that variable is also changed <i>outside</i> of the function.\n",
    "* Python is <i>pass by object</i>. That means Python <i>appears</i> to be pass by value (when the variable does not change) and pass by reference (when the variable does change); it is dependent on the mutability of the object. When you pass in an immutable object (tuple, string, numeric [float, int, bool]), then the variable outside the function call will be not be changed by what happens inside the function call. When you pass in a mutable object (list, set, dictionary), then when the variable is changed inside the function, then it is also changed outside of the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, Python's assigment (=) NEVER copies data, not even in a function's argument assignment. The assignment just creates another name tag pointing to the same object."

    "* Design Patterns (https://github.com/faif/python-patterns): Decades ago, 4 authors (known as the Gang of Four) wrote a book called <i>Design Patterns</i> to explain how to make a language do cool stuff (ie reuasable solutions to commonly occuring problems). Older languages benefitted from design pattern due to their limitations. Fortunately in Python, you don't have to worry about design patterns as much since Python has built in a lot of cool functionality for you. However, if you ever have a tough problem to solve, you can take a look at this GitHub repo to see if you can benefit from a already solved/battle-tested solution."

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "Python is ever changing and improving. Remember the reason you learn about Python is not because you want to ~~get a pay raise~~ argue with your (nerdy) friends. It is because you care about interesting problems and how to solve them (in a better way). And it isn't really about Python--it's about you. In a programmer's lifetime, all the code you will ever write will fit neatly into a small USB flash drive. The millions of lines of code you write will weigh 0.00000000001 pounds. Code is invisible and weightless but ever-present and evermore expanding.   \n",
    "But the power of your imagination is boundless. Napoleon Hill's  epiphany is \"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.\" What will you want to create? What you imagine, you can bring forth into the real world--and code is just a tool to realize that dream. Though \"software is eating the world\", at the end of the day the problems you try to solve with code is to improve human lives. Coding is fundamentally a human-centered mission. Advanced Python is a McGuffin: Python isn't a destination, it is a journey.  \n",
