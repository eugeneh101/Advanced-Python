# So you want to be a ~~millionaire~~ awesome Python programmer? 

* You want to code like the pros.
* You want to write elegant, clean code that your colleagues consider "best practice" (AKA "idiomatic" Python).
* You want to write high-quality code, so that you and your colleagues can maintain it in the future ... so you can go home earlier AND PARTY IT UP.
* You  want to be the coolest programmer on your team, get promoted to Senior Principal Python Genius, and make the BIG $$$!
* You want to learn how the descriptor protocol implements magic method calls, which you can hijack by inserting malicious code into super classes such that method calls up the C3 linearization graph destroy your competitor's code! 

Well, if you are reading this notebook for the right reasons, you'll be a __certified Python Pro!__ If not..., even better: you'll be a __millionaire  watching your competitor crying in ruins!__

# Why Python?
Python takes a Multi-paradigm approach:
* Procedural programming: C, Rust, Cython
* Object-oriented data modelling (OOP): Java, C#, Eiffel
* Computational pipeline modelling (Functional Programming): Haskell, Scala, Clojure, F#
* Array-oriented data processing: MATLAB/Octave, Julia, R
* Event driven programming (async): JavaScript, Go, Erlang, Elixir
* Pragmatic problem solving: Lua, PHP, Perl
