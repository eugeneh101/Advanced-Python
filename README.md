# So you want to be a ~~millionaire~~ awesome Python programmer? 

* You want to code like the pros.
* You want to write elegant, clean code that your colleagues consider "best practice" (AKA "idiomatic" Python).
* You want to write high-quality code, so that you and your colleagues can maintain it in the future ... so you can go home earlier AND PARTY IT UP.
* You  want to be the coolest programmer on your team, get promoted to Senior Principal Python Genius, and make the BIG $$$!
* You want to learn how the descriptor protocol implements magic method calls, which you can hijack by inserting malicious code into super classes such that method calls up the C3 linearization graph destroy your competitor's code! 

Well, if you are reading this notebook for the right reasons, you'll be a __certified Python Pro!__ If not..., even better: you'll be a __millionaire  watching your competitor crying in ruins!__

# Why Python?
Python takes a Multi-paradigm approach:
* Pragmatic problem solving: Lua, PHP, Perl
* Procedural programming: C, Rust, Cython
* Object-oriented programming: Java, C#, Eiffel
* Functional programming: Haskell, Scala, Clojure, F#
* High performance with parallel/array-oriented processing: MATLAB/Octave, Julia, R, Rust, Go
* Event-driven programming (async): JavaScript, Go, Erlang, Elixir



Guido van Rossum (retired Benevolent Dictator for Life [BFDL]) emphasizes readability over speed. Here's some other fundamental core tenets of Python.

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!


# Another Easter egg
from __future__ import braces
# SyntaxError: not a chance
```
